                - Randomly select either the hero or monster to hit the other character.
                - Have the character with the higher health hit the other character ( Makes for longer battles )
                - Have both the hero and monster do damage to each other ( Makes for shorter battles )
                - Use the number of characters left in either the heroes or monsters lists to influence the outcome ( Closer battles )
                - Randomly scale the amount of damage a character inflicts.

            NOTES:
                - Make sure to call the TakeDamage( damageAmount ) method on whichever character(s) is receiving damage ( *See CharacterStats.cs )
                - Remember after doing damage to check if a character's health is equal to or less than zero, and if so, Destroy() the character's gameObject.
                - Make sure to assign some text describing the outcome to the log variable
                    eg "The " + characterDoingDamage.name + " hits the " + characterTakingDamage.name + " for " + characterDoingDamage.damage + " damage! It has " + characterTakingDamage.health + " HP remaining"
